<p>Fitness, as we know it today, seems to be a relatively modern invention &ndash; something that started vaguely in the 70s with jogging and Jazzercise. But physical exercise obviously goes back much further than that, to a time where people wouldn&rsquo;t have thought of it as working out, but rather a way of life. Centuries and millennia ago, they did not have all the machines and weights and gyms that we have today, and yet they were in better shape than we are. To understand why this is, how we got to our modern fitness culture, and what we have lost along the way, it&rsquo;s helpful to take a look at the history of exercise.</p>
